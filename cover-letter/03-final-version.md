Dear Hiring Team,
I am excited to apply for the Full Stack Developer position. My experience combines backend engineering with applied machine learning, demonstrated through my Pneumonia Detection System built using Django and multiple CNN architectures.
In this project, I designed and implemented a scalable Django backend that integrates dynamic model selection, structured database management, secure authentication, and analytical dashboards. One of the most technically challenging aspects was designing a dynamic model loading system that allowed multiple trained CNN models to be selected at runtime without excessive memory overhead. This required careful architectural planning and optimization.
I approach development with an engineering mindset — focusing not only on building features but also on maintainability, performance, and system design. I value clean architecture, structured documentation, and thoughtful problem-solving.
While I may not have a high frequency of public GitHub contributions, I actively build and experiment with projects locally. My focus has been on developing complete systems rather than incremental commits. I am continuously working to improve my documentation and collaboration practices.
If helpful, I would welcome the opportunity to complete a technical task or challenge to further demonstrate my skills and suitability for this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
Sahal M S
