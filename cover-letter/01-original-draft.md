Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Developer position. I have been working on projects that combine backend development and machine learning, including a pneumonia detection system built using Django and multiple CNN models.
Through this project, I gained experience integrating deep learning models with a web application, managing authentication systems, handling databases, and building dashboards to visualize data. One of the most challenging parts was dynamically loading different models based on user selection while maintaining performance.
I focus on understanding how systems work internally rather than just making features function. I enjoy solving backend logic problems and optimizing workflows.
I do not use GitHub very frequently for daily contributions, but I actively work on projects locally and focus more on building complete systems. I am open to improving my collaboration and documentation practices further.
If possible, I would welcome any technical task or challenge to demonstrate my skills for this position.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Sahal M S
